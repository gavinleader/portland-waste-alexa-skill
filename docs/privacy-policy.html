      <h1>Portland Waste Alexa Skill Privacy Policy</h1>
      <p><strong>Last Update: March 4, 2019</strong></p>
      <p>This privacy policy describes how the Portland Waste Alexa Skill protects and makes use of the information you give the software when you use the Alexa voice skill. We respect the privacy of our users, and have taken careful consideration to not expose any information that is not already publicly available.</p>

      <h2>Data collection</h2>
      <p>In order to provide personalized collection schedule data, we ask for your home address through either device permissions or voice commands. This address information is processed through this skill's software to store a property ID and collection information using encryption techniques.</p>

      <h2>Changes or amendments</h2>
      <p>We may change, suspend, or discontinue the skill, or any part of it, at any time without notice. This policy is updated from time to time.</p>
